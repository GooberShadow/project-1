I have created a makefile that will compile what is needed using command "make"
Run the program after compiling it by using "./a.out" 
If you wish to include a file as an argument when running the program you would type "./a.out filename"
If not then the program will allow you to type from the keyboard until you wish to stop. when you wish to stop hold ctrl and press "d"

Note: I did not include a tree.h file as I have my binary tree and function associated with said tree set up inside of a class and which means I could not set up a tree.h. However the project requirements do not explicitly state I need a tree.h file. It simply says "put the above four functions into file tree.c/tree.h." I have those four fuctions in tree.c inside of my class BinarySearchTree.
